# Note Project

This project aims to develop a simple Android appllication using Java. It will have similar functionalities compared to Evernote but with only some core functions, such as view all, sort, add, update, delete notes (text, image, audio) and restore deleted notes.

> Basic functions that enable users to log in, register and view their profiles are as well included. 

> This is used as an assignment project in university.


*Written in Java, with MVC 2 architecture, Firebase Cloud Firestore, and Material Design on Android Studio 4.2.1
